## Introduction

The **PipBoy Pygame Project** is an interactive application inspired by the iconic Pip-Boy interface from the *Fallout* series. Built using [Pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce), this project simulates various aspects of the Pip-Boy interface, including interactive menus, inventory displays, and dynamic UI elements. It is designed both as a fun project and as a learning tool for Python game development.

I have used the great pipboy project from [Zapwizard](https://github.com/zapwizard/pypboy), but this entire project is built from the ground up.

## Features

- **Retro UI Design:** Inspired by the classic Pip-Boy interface with a modern twist.
- **Interactive Menus:** Navigate through different screens such as inventory, stats, and map.
- **Customizable Modules:** Easily add or modify modules (e.g., radio, stats, inventory) to suit your needs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12 or later:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Pygame:** This project uses Pygame-ce for its graphical interface.
- **Optional: Pip** to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

### Steps

It is recommended to first run the project on your windows machine to ensure everything works as expected. Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelmes1/pipboy-pi.git
   cd pipboy-pi
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python modules/main.py
   ```

### Raspberry Pi Zero 2W Setup

For deployment on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with DietPI:

1. **Flash DietPI:**
   - Download [DietPI](https://dietpi.com/) for Raspberry Pi
   - Flash to SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager

2. **Install System Dependencies:**
```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y python3-pygame python3-pip git
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

3. **Copy Configuration Files:**

   After cloning the repository, copy system configs:
```bash
   # Backup originals first!
   sudo cp /boot/firmware/config.txt /boot/firmware/config.txt.backup
   sudo cp /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt.backup
   
   # Copy Pip-Boy configs
   sudo cp config/config.txt /boot/firmware/
   sudo cp config/cmdline.txt /boot/firmware/
   sudo cp config/dietpi.txt /boot/
   sudo cp config/Automation_Custom_Script.sh /boot/
   sudo cp config/pipboy.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

4. **Enable Service:**
```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable pipboy.service
   sudo systemctl start pipboy.service
```

5. **Reboot:**
```bash
   sudo reboot
```

### Hardware Configuration

- **Display:** MPI3508 3.5" touchscreen (SPI)
- **Audio:** Onboard or MAX98357A I2S amplifiers
- **Input:** MT6701 rotary encoder (I2C) + 5-position selector
- **Motor:** Stepper motor with DRV8834 driver

See `config/` folder for GPIO pin mappings and wiring diagrams.

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Configuration files in `config/` are specific to this Pip-Boy build:**
- `config.txt` - Custom display settings (320x255, boot screen color)
- `cmdline.txt` - Kernel parameters for terminal colors
- `dietpi.txt` - DietPI automation settings
- `pipboy.service` - Systemd service for auto-start

**Always backup original files before replacing!**

📻 **Audio files:**
- Radio files should be in MP3 format (320kbps recommended)
- Place in `sounds/radio/[station_name]/`
- Perk sounds: `sounds/pipboy/PerkMenu/[perk_name].ogg`


## Usage

Once you have installed all the prerequisites and dependencies, running the project is straightforward. Here are some usage tips:

- **Navigation:** Use your keyboard (or mapped controller keys) to navigate through the Pip-Boy interface.
- **Modules:** Switch between different modules like Inventory, Stats, or Map using the on-screen prompts.
- **Customization:** Modify the settings with `configure.py` to change UI themes, key bindings, or module behavior.
